    "answer: - Yes, Any permutation of original sequence that preserves both the marginal dinucleotide and mononucleotide counts must start and end with the letters that are at the beginning and end of the original sequence (here A and A), but we can start and end with other letters when we want to find dinucleotide permutations that do not preserve the mononucleotide composition. It is possible for this sequence that starts and ends with (A) and by using a graph (A2C,C2G,G2C,C2T,T2G,G2A) we could have following dinucleotide permutations that do not preserve the mononucleotide composition:\n",
    "- CTGACGC, GACTGCG and TGACGCT which do not preserve the mononucleotide permutation.(For example in CTGACGC we have 3C,2G,1A,1T and in original sequence we have 2C,2G,2A,1T, so CTGACGC cannot also preserve mononucleotide permutation and it is the same for GACTGCG and TGACGCT)\n"
